# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.
The webpage is not functional yetvin that you cannot actually book a table or place orders, but has the appearance it's supposed to have.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to make the about and footer sections a little more interesting. Perhaps add in another animation, a picture, or maybe a little quip. Something that would pop against the dark blue color would be really nice, I think. And maybe some robot arms randomly across the pages as you scroll down.
